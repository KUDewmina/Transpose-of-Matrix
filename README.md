# Transpose-of-Matrix
This python code can print transpose of any matrix.
I haven't used any libraries for this and coded as Lab project in our university.

# Given Challenge
The question ask me to get elements as rows seperated by white spaces and when user gives " -1 " as input ,the transposed matrix should print.
And also asked to print "Invalid Matrix" when the rows are not completed and print "Error" if there occured any other error.

# Instructions
You have to print elements rowise seperated by spaces.After inputed first row ,you have to press 'Enter' and input next row.This will repeat infinitely.When you inputted all rows ,then input '-1' .Then you will receive the transposed matrix for your Matrix.
